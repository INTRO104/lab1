    "Documentation of your code, or explaining to other people what it does and how it works, is an important part of programming and data analysis.  So important that we're starting our first lab with it!  That's also why you're using jupyter - there are many other choices of IDE (integrated development environment) that we could be using, jupyter is nice because it makes documentation easy and therefore more likely.\n",
    "\n",

You can start by simply writing text and it will show up.  To add some formatting, like you see above, try out various options that you can find at this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).\n",
